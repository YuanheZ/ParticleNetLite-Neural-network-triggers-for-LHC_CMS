Title:
Using Machine Learning to develop fast selection algorithms for the CMS detector at the LHC

The LHC can generate hundreds of millions of data in microseconds. But physicists are interested in only some of them. Our research is based on the LHC level 1 layer. Aims to filter out data of interest using neural networks. At present, the signal data collected by the LHC collector can be stored in 2D image format, so we can apply convolutional neural network for learning. The goal of the study was to compare the ability of different types of neural networks to filtering signals.
